# Ask me a question 🤓

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/gbsk-an/ask-a-question/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions
Check out the [closed issues](https://github.com/gbsk-an/ask-a-question/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
